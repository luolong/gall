A command line utility to work with multiple Git repositories at a time.

Most of the command line insofar as it has been implemented, will be following the
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain[git porcelain] command line interface
with the notable difference that instead of working on a single repository, these commands will be executed
on multiple repositories (in parallel).

== Status of the project

:warning-icon: 🚧

[WARNING]
**This is very much a Work In Progress effort.**
I am building this tool first and foremost for my own use in order to make something useful and learn Rust in the process.

The features may be incomplete or buggy, progress slow and inconsistent and code can be messy at times.

I do however intend to accept pull requests and have a discussion around implementation details, ux and features that would move this project forward faster.

Do not expect fast feedback cycle however. I do have a life and a job, but I will do my best.


== Git commands implemented:

- [x] `list`    — List all git repositories gall will be operating on
- [ ] `status`  — Fancy status report across multiple repositories
- [ ] `pull`    — Pull changes from remote repository

=== List

[source,bash]
