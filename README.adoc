= Manage your git repos with gall

A command line utility to work with multiple Git repositories at a time.

Most of the command line insofar as it has been implemented, will be following the
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain[git porcelain] command line interface
with the notable difference that instead of working on a single repository, these commands will be executed
on multiple repositories (in parallel).

== Git commands implemented:

- [ ] `list`    --- List all git repositories gall will be operating on
- [ ] 'status'  --- Like `git status`, show current worktree status for all repositories
- [ ]

=== List

List all git repositories gall will be operating on.

[source,bash]
gall [OPTIONS] list
